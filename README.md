# Python experiments
Some experiments in Python, as my learning resource.

## Scripts
The folder scripts contains simple Python scripts. The scripts usually have enough comments to understand the purpose. There is a folder about the computer vision topic. Those scripts require an installation of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org).
## Notebooks
Those Notebooks contain a bit more plain text together with the Python code.
