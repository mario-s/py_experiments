    "Minimax is a classic algorithm for finding the best move in a two-player, zero-sum game with perfect information, like tic-tac-toe, checkers, or chess. It has been extended and modified for other types of games as well. Minimax is typically implemented using a recursive function in which each player is designated either the maximizing player or the minimizing player.\n",

    "The maximizing player aims to find the move that will lead to maximal gains. However, the maximizing player must account for moves by the minimizing player. After each attempt to maximize the gains of the maximizing player, minimax is called recursively to find the opponent’s reply that minimizes the maximizing player’s gains. This continues back and forth (maximizing, minimizing, maximizing, and so on) until a base case in the recursive function is reached. The base case is a terminal position (a win or a draw) or a maximal search depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimax will return an evaluation of the starting position for the maximizing player. For the evaluate() method of the TTTBoard class, if the best possible play by both sides will result in a win for the maximizing player, a score of 1 will be returned. If the best play will result in a loss, -1 is returned. A 0 is returned if the best play is a draw.\n",

    "These numbers are returned when a base case is reached. They then bubble up through all of the recursive calls that led to the base case.

Pieces fall from the top of the grid to the bottom until they hit the bottom or another piece. In essence, the player’s only decision each turn is which of the seven columns to drop a piece into. The player may not drop it into a full column. The first player that has four pieces of their color next to one another with no breaks in a row, column, or diagonal wins. If no player achieves this, and the grid is completely filled, the game is a draw.\n",

    "Some of the following code will look very familiar, but the data structures and the evaluation method are quite different from tic-tac-toe. Both games are implemented as subclasses of the same base Piece and Board classes you saw at the beginning of the chapter, making minimax() usable for both games."

    "Minimax works well, but we are not getting a very deep search at present. There is a small extension to minimax, known as alpha-beta pruning, that can improve search depth by excluding positions in the search that will not result in improvements over positions already searched. This magic is accomplished by keeping track of two values between recursive minimax calls: alpha and beta. Alpha represents the evaluation of the best maximizing move found up to this point in the search tree, and beta represents the evaluation of the best minimizing move found so far for the opponent. If beta is ever less than or equal to alpha, it’s not worth further exploring this branch of the search, because a better or equivalent move has already been found than what will be found farther down this branch. This heuristic decreases the search space significantly. "
