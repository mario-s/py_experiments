    "\n",
    "If a thief could take any amount of any item, he could simply divide each item’s value by its weight to figure out the most valuable items for the available capacity. But to make the scenario more realistic, let’s say that the thief cannot take half of an item (such as 2.5 televisions). Instead, we will come up with a way to solve the 0/1 variant of the problem, so-called because it enforces another rule: The thief may only take one or none of each item. "

    "If we tried to solve this problem using a brute-force approach, we would look at every combination of items available to be put in the knapsack. For the mathematically inclined, this is known as a powerset, and a powerset of a set (in our case, the set of items) has 2^N different possible subsets, where N is the number of items. Therefore, we would need to analyze 2^N combinations (O(2^N)). This is okay for a small number of items, but it is untenable for a large number. Any approach that solves a problem using an exponential number of steps is an approach we want to avoid.\n",

Instead of solving a problem outright with a brute-force approach, in dynamic programming one solves subproblems that make up the larger problem, stores those results, and utilizes those stored results to solve the larger problem. As long as the capacity of the knapsack is considered in discrete steps, the problem can be solved with dynamic programming. \n",

A salesman must visit all of the cities on a map exactly once, returning to his start city at the end of the journey. There is a direct connection from every city to every other city, and the salesman may visit the cities in any order. What is the shortest path for the salesman? \n",

Your first instinct might be to find the minimum spanning tree, as described in chapter 4. Unfortunately, the solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem is not so simple. The minimum spanning tree is the shortest way to connect all of the cities, but it does not provide the shortest path for visiting all of them exactly once. \n",
