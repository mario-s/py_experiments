    "# Graph problems\n",
    "A graph is an abstract mathematical construct that is used for modeling a real-world problem by dividing the problem into a set of connected nodes. We call each of the nodes a vertex and each of the connections an edge. For instance, a subway map can be thought of as a graph representing a transportation network. Each of the dots represents a station, and each of the lines represents a route between two stations. In graph terminology, we would call the stations “vertices” and the routes “edges.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this useful? Not only do graphs help us abstractly think about a problem, but they also let us apply several well-understood and performant search and optimization techniques. For instance, in the subway example, suppose we want to know the shortest route from one station to another. Or suppose we want to know the minimum amount of track needed to connect all of the stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a graph framework\n",
    "We want this graph framework to be as flexible as possible so that it can represent as many different problems as possible. To achieve this goal, we will use generics to abstract away the type of the vertices. Every vertex will ultimately be assigned an integer index, but it will be stored as the user-defined generic type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start work on the framework by defining the Edge class, which is the simplest machinery in our graph framework. An Edge is defined as a connection between two vertices, each of which is represented by an integer index. By convention, u is used to refer to the first vertex, and v is used to represent the second vertex. You can also think of u as “from” and v as “to.” In this chapter, we are only working with undirected graphs (graphs with edges that allow travel in both directions), but in directed graphs, also known as digraphs, edges can also be one-way. The reversed() method is meant to return an Edge that travels in the opposite direction of the edge it is applied to.  "

    "The Graph class focuses on the essential role of a graph: associating vertices with edges. The _vertices list is the heart of a Graph. Each vertex will be stored in the list, but we will later refer to them by their integer index in the list. The vertex itself may be a complex data type, but its index will always be an int, which is easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to implement a graph data structure, but the two most common are to use a vertex matrix or adjacency lists. In a vertex matrix, each cell of the matrix represents the intersection of two vertices in the graph, and the value of that cell indicates the connection (or lack thereof) between them. Our graph data structure uses adjacency lists. In this graph representation, every vertex has a list of vertices that it is connected to. Our specific representation uses a list of lists of edges, so for every vertex there is a list of edges via which the vertex is connected to other vertices. _edges is this list of lists. "

    "### Dijkstra’s algorithm \n",
    "Dijkstra’s algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem. It is provided a starting vertex, and it returns the lowest-weight path to any other vertex on a weighted graph. It also returns the minimum total weight to every other vertex from the starting vertex. Dijkstra’s algorithm starts at the single-source vertex and then continually explores the closest vertices to the starting vertex. For this reason, like Jarník’s algorithm, Dijkstra’s algorithm is greedy. When Dijkstra’s algorithm encounters a new vertex, it keeps track of how far it is from the starting vertex and updates this value if it ever finds a shorter path. It also keeps track of which edge got it to each vertex, like a breadth-first search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are all of the algorithm’s steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add the starting vertex to a priority queue.\n",
    "- Pop the closest vertex from the priority queue (at the beginning, this is just the starting vertex); we’ll call it the current vertex.\n",
    "- Look at all of the neighbors connected to the current vertex. If they have not previously been recorded, or if the edge offers a new shortest path to them, then for each of them record its distance from the start, record the edge that produced this distance, and add the new vertex to the priority queue.\n",
    "- Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the priority queue is empty.\n",
    "- Return the shortest distance to every vertex from the starting vertex and the path to get to each of them.\n",
