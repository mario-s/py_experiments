    "# K-means clustering \n",
    "Clustering is a computational technique that divides the points in a data set into groups. A successful clustering results in groups that contain points that are related to one another. Whether those relationships are meaningful generally requires human verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In clustering, the group (a.k.a. cluster) that a data point belongs to is not predetermined, but instead is decided during the run of the clustering algorithm. In fact, the algorithm is not guided to place any particular data point in any particular cluster by presupposed information. For this reason, clustering is considered an unsupervised method within the realm of machine learning. You can think of unsupervised as meaning not guided by foreknowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means is a clustering algorithm that attempts to group data points into a certain predefined number of clusters, based on each point’s relative distance to the center of the cluster. In every round of k-means, the distance between every data point and every center of a cluster (a point known as a centroid) is calculated. Points are assigned to the cluster whose centroid they are closest to. Then the algorithm recalculates all of the centroids, finding the mean of each cluster’s assigned points and replacing the old centroid with the new mean. The process of assigning points and recalculating centroids continues until the centroids stop moving or a certain number of iterations occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is our k-means clustering algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize all of the data points and “k” empty clusters.\n",
    "- Normalize all of the data points.\n",
    "- Create random centroids associated with each cluster.\n",
    "- Assign each data point to the cluster of the centroid it is closest to.\n",
    "- Recalculate each centroid so it is the center (mean) of the cluster it is associated with.\n",
    "- Repeat steps 4 and 5 until a maximum number of iterations is reached or the centroids stop moving (convergence).\n"
